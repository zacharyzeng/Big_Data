All told, the Textio blog got hundreds of thousands of visitors last year. Our readership is executive, global, and growing fast. As more and more leaders realize that augmented writing is going to define enterprise technology over the next decade, there is a voracious appetite for data narratives about the way people are writing and talking.

You know how to tell data stories for real people; your work speaks not only to data scientists and linguists, but to anyone.
You understand that the best data narratives are funny, fascinating, or both.
You have a background in linguistics, psychology, data journalism, or another social science, and/or you know how to use math to understand how language works and explain it to people.
You know how to make a story last across channels (social media, webinar, email marketing, etc.) and bring a testing mentality help us improve. You’re eager to prove that you can innovate by trying new tactics.
You are a superb communicator verbally and in writing—Textio stands for editorial quality, and you do too.

Investigative Data Journalist,The Markup,"New York, NY",2018-11-10 17:37:02,https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=32b638197982e277,NaN,indeed,"$95,000 a yearWelcome. We are The Markup (https://themarkup.org/ ( https://themarkup.org/ )) -- a brand new nonpartisan, nonprofit journalism organization in New York City. We're hiring!

Our mission is to investigate and illuminate the societal effects of new technologies. With little accountability or oversight, technology is affecting who we vote for, how we raise our kids, who is able to get housing, jobs, healthcare and a comfortable life. We will investigate these impacts, with the goal of holding the powerful to account, raising the cost of bad behavior, and spurring reforms. We begin publishing in 2019.

The Markup is seeking Investigative Data Journalists to collect and analyze data showing the impacts of technology on society, have strong news judgement and can see stories in a dataset. This position reports to the Managing Editor.

The Markup is committed to building a team that includes a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives, and an organizational culture that is reader-centered, inventive, rigorous, and courageous. A collaborative team-based approach is core for us: we won't tolerate jerks. We aim to be a place where a diverse mix of dedicated people will want to come, to stay, and do their best work. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, country of origin, citizenship, ancestry, physical or mental disability, or veteran status.

------------------
About the position
------------------

Investigations are the heart of what we do. Our approach to investigative journalism is guided by the scientific method. We develop hypotheses and assemble data — through crowdsourcing, FOIA requests, and automated data collection — to test our theories.

Investigative journalism is a team sport. The Markup's Investigative Data Journalists and Investigative Reporters work closely together on stories, and they work with Graphics Editors to help visually explain their findings.

The Markup's investigative data journalists are skilled at working with large and messy datasets, scraping websites, running statistics, finding outside experts and sources, and most importantly knowing what is a story and isn't a story. They are proud of the clean code they write, the statistical tests they run, and can clearly communicate their findings. In short, they produce the facts we rely on for our investigations.

----------------
Responsibilities
----------------

On large investigations you will be responsible for writing methodologies that explain your work, and helping to write the main feature. You care about the quality of your work, so your code is clean, your analysis repeatable, and your prose is clear.

You are crafty. You have a bunch of story ideas, and are on the lookout for more. You know where to gather data, how to collect it, and importantly what to collect.

You are accurate. You won't begin to analyze a dataset until you are certain it is free of errors.

You are an explorer. You visualize the data first before running statistical tests, so you can see where a story might be.

You are collaborative. You work well on teams, and know that holding the powerful to account is what matters.

You know what you don't know. You don't hesitate to pick up the phone to ask questions, find outside statistical help for analysis, can get academics and researchers to review your findings before publication and generally enjoy learning new things.

You value clarity. You know a simple analysis with clear findings is better than a complicated one done with fancy and sophisticated techniques.

You are open and transparent. The Markup shares the data and code behind our investigations, so the Investigative Data Journalist writes code with a reader in mind. And you can write prose precise enough for a technical reader, but approachable for a general audience.

You are experienced. You've worked on data driven stories and know what it takes to develop and execute a data driven story. .

You will also be the custodian of your own digital security. We will provide the tools, but you will need to use two-factor authentication, password managers, encryption and other tools and tactics to protect our work and our sources.

------
Skills
------

You should be comfortable in at least a couple of programming languages, and know which one to use for each task. At The Markup, we use Node.js for scraping, python or ruby for data cleaning and parsing, PostgreSQL and ElasticSearch databases for storage, and R for analysis. We've also used a bit of Rust, so you can use newer or esoteric programming languages if they fit the task. Just know that if you do, you'll be the one responsible for maintaining it. You don't need to know all of these languages and tools, but having knowledge of a few of them is a definite plus.

You should be comfortable on the command line: sometimes a story is just a grep away. The same goes for spreadsheet software like Excel: sometimes you'll find a story in a single cell.

You don't need to be a stats expert, but you should be stats curious. You should be conversant in basic statistics and analysis, and have a commitment to learning on the job.

We're looking for someone who has a strong sense of the limits of his/her own knowledge, so that when you encounter a new problem you ask first: whether that is meeting with an academic, asking questions internally, doing open source research, reading complicated academic papers, filing a FOIA request, or picking up the phone to call a source.

There isn't a template for this job, you might come from a graphics desk, a data desk or have worked outside of journalism. The only thing we ask for is that you have a bachelor's degree and a few years of relevant experience.

We are building an organizational culture that is reader-centered, inventive, rigorous, and courageous. A collaborative team-centered approach is a core value for our team.

------------
Compensation
------------

We pay people fair and reasonable salaries, in accordance with their skills and abilities and experience. We'll also provide a generous benefits package that includes medical, dental, vision, life, disability, pet insurance and retirement plan contributions.

The salary for this position begins at $95,000, and will be established based on the candidate's experience, education and skills.

------------
How to apply
------------

We have engaged DRi Consulting to assist us with this search. To apply, please use the form below to submit a cover letter, resume, 3-5 clips of your previous work, and 3-5 story ideas for investigations you might want to pursue if you joined us. Applications that don't include a cover letter will not be considered. Please do not contact the hiring manager directly. Please do not send a CV or application package to staff at their individual email addresses. If you do, it will probably just get lost.

This position will work out of our New York City office. If you don't currently live in New York but are willing to relocate for this position, please make that clear in your cover letter. We will pay relocation expenses for successful candidates.

At this time, we can't consider applications from people who don't already have the legal right to work in the United States. In order to work for The Markup, you'll be required to provide documentation establishing that you're eligible for U.S. employment."

Investigative Reporter,The Markup,"New York, NY",2018-11-10 17:37:10,https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=c9d0d34abce26648,NaN,indeed,"$95,000 a yearWelcome. We are The Markup (https://themarkup.org/ ( https://themarkup.org/ )) -- a brand new nonpartisan, nonprofit journalism organization in New York City. We're hiring!

Our mission is to investigate and illuminate the societal effects of new technologies. With little accountability or oversight, technology is affecting who we vote for, how we raise our kids, who is able to get housing, jobs, healthcare and a comfortable life. We will investigate these impacts, with the goal of holding the powerful to account, raising the cost of bad behavior, and spurring reforms. We begin publishing in 2019.

The Markup is looking for Investigative Reporters who are newer to the field but have demonstrated investigative and data skills.

The Markup is committed to building a team that includes a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives, and an organizational culture that is reader-centered, inventive, rigorous, and courageous. A collaborative team-based approach is core for us: we won't tolerate jerks. We aim to be a place where a diverse mix of dedicated people will want to come, to stay, and do their best work. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, country of origin, citizenship, ancestry, physical or mental disability, or veteran status.

------------------
About the position
------------------

We are seeking an inventive, rigorous and collaborative Investigative Reporter who can lead investigations, is comfortable with data and spreadsheets, and can write compelling articles based on our findings.

Our approach to investigative journalism is guided by the scientific method. We develop hypotheses and assemble data —through crowdsourcing, FOIA requests, and automated data collection— to test our theories.

Investigative Reporters will work alongside a Data Journalist to conduct investigations. Together they will develop a hypothesis and strategize about data collection techniques. The Investigative Reporter will develop the necessary domain expertise in the topic area, find interesting anecdotes to illustrate the findings and conceive and shape the narrative of the article.

This position will report to the Editor-in-Chief.

------------------------
Responsibilities include
------------------------

Investigations are the heart of The Markup's work. Investigative Reporters will be responsible for working closely with Data Journalists, producing and writing several investigations per quarter, as well as explanatory articles.

Investigative Journalism is a team sport. The Markup's Investigative Reporters will work closely with Investigative Data Journalists to develop hypotheses, collect data and develop findings. You will also work with other parts of the newsroom to explain and promote your findings and with our editorial partners outside the newsroom.

You will also be the custodian of your own digital security. We will provide the tools, but you will need to use two-factor authentication, password managers, encryption and other tools and tactics that can help us protect our work and our sources.

----------------------
Qualifications include
----------------------

Because our team- and data-based approach to journalism is new, there won't be many people who have done it before. Don't worry if you haven't done the exact type of data journalism we plan to practice. The skills and experience we are looking for include:

You have strong data judgement and can see a story in a dataset.

You know how to spot a story. You have a minimum of several years of experience generating enterprising news articles.

You know how to dive deep. You have worked on investigations (even if your previous employer didn't give you much time to do them!).

You are a fast, clean writer. You have spent several years writing news articles on a deadline.

You are passionate about accuracy. You are willing to go the extra mile to check even facts that seem obvious.

You are skilled at cultivating relationships with sources and are diligent about protecting them.

You can use Excel (maybe you are not an expert, but are willing to learn).

You enjoy learning and are flexible. This is a new form of journalism and we'll all be learning how to do it together.

Experience covering the technology industry is a plus, but not a requirement.

------------
Compensation
------------

We pay people fair and reasonable salaries, in accordance with their skills and abilities and experience. We also provide a generous benefits package that includes medical, dental, vision, life, disability, and pet insurance and retirement plan contributions.

The salary for this position begins at $95,000, and will be established based on the successful candidate's experience, education and skills.

------------
How to apply
------------

We have engaged DRi Consulting to assist us with this search. To apply, please fill out the form below and submit a cover letter, resume, 3-5 clips of your previous work, and 3-5 story ideas for investigations you might want to pursue if you joined us. Applications that don't include a cover letter will not be considered. Please do not contact the hiring manager directly. Please do not send a CV or application package to staff at their individual email addresses. If you do, it will probably just get lost.

This position will work out of our New York City office. If you don't currently live in New York but are willing to relocate for this position, please make that clear in your cover letter. We will pay relocation expenses for successful candidates.

At this time, we can't consider applications from people who don't already have the legal right to work in the United States. In order to work for The Markup, you'll be required to provide documentation establishing that you're eligible for U.S. employment."

US Campaigns Director,Change.org,"New York, NY 10038 (Financial District area)",2018-11-03 17:37:14,https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=55bf84fddcfa9e75,NaN,indeed,"$74,500 a yearChange.org is the world’s largest technology platform for social change, with over 250 million users. Our team spans 18 countries and empowers hundreds of millions of people to have a voice and fight injustice. Nearly every hour, a petition on Change.org achieves victory. We’re working to build a world where no one is powerless and where creating change is a part of everyday life.

About the role
The Campaigns Director will lead campaigns for Change.org in the United States, supporting petition starters to win the change they want to see. The Director is responsible for allocating resources across campaigns and leading and managing the US campaigns team.

This is Coach/Player role - you’d lead a team of campaigners, and run your own campaigns portfolio. The Campaigns Director will drive the success of the US team through coaching, training, mentorship, accountability and excellent campaigning.

In the US there are hundreds of campaigns started on Change.org every single day, on everything from ending mass shootings to curbing food waste in grocery stores to ending corruption in government and everything in between. On Change.org, everyday people are starting campaigns, mobilizing supporters, and convincing decision makers to drive solutions. We're looking for an experienced leader to help the heroes that start these campaigns win more, win loudly, and win more often.
You’re a strong leader. You will:
Manage a growing team of ~3 campaigns staff who work with petition starters to win big, brand-defining campaigns that drive impact, revenue, and traffic. This could include mentoring starters and offering strategic campaign support to ensure campaigns build momentum and drive toward victory;
Set a positive culture for US campaigns team that is solutions-focused, and driven by the overarching values that guide Change.org;
Drive team process and accountability to maximize opportunities to run and win campaigns that spur national attention and start important conversations;
Ensure Change.org is relevant in moments that demand a rapid response;
Contribute to our global leadership team and coordinate with other national teams on global campaigns, work with our technologists on innovation and experiments and collaborate constantly; and
Ensure that campaigns supported by the US team regularly drive broad, diverse media coverage of Change.org and our petition starters, working closely with US communications staff to be on top of major news stories and media moments.
You’re an excellent campaigner. You will:
Design, manage and win major campaigns with their starters - through campaign narrative, strategy, tactics, timelines, and media- and win them loudly so that the petitions and their starters and signers are core components of the victory and the story about it;
Write compelling and emotional text, and create great visual content- often on tight deadlines - that tells the stories of campaigns and petition starters to Change.org users. You will be writing and creating content for upwards of 20+ million Change.org users, as well as for other stakeholders as needed (journalists, decision-makers, internal staff, etc.);
Lead multiple campaigns at any given time (likely several active campaigns any given week) multi-tasking, meeting deadlines, and keeping track of details and relationships; and
Engage with senior political and corporate decision makers across the country to facilitate their responses and engagement.
You could be the ideal candidate if some of these describe you:
You’re committed to our mission of empowering people everywhere to win campaigns on the critical issues of our times;
You run and win campaigns. From mapping power and influence, to leveraging media, creative tactics that engage people across the country - you’re a campaigner, first and foremost;
You're driven by results, crave the next victory and are always on the hunt for the next big opportunity to change the world;
You've got deep knowledge of and a passion for American media and politics (news and social media junkies desired!), and know how to get a story to cut through in a busy newsroom;
You’ve successfully raised money online;
You have experience creating content, advertising, community and reach through the right channels for the right audiences;
You have impeccable email and copywriting skills, a strong sense of narrative, and can turn out compelling copy at short notice under tight timelines;
You're willing to take risks, fail, and adapt - and are constantly curious about how to improve your work; and
You've got a strong sense of fun and give-and-take - our team is constantly pushing the envelope and each other to challenge assumptions, go all-in, and imagine the impossible.
Talent, enthusiasm, and leadership matter more to us than ticking boxes. If even one or two of the criteria on our wishlist speak to you and you’re excited about this role, we want to hear from you.

This is a full-time opportunity, and the ideal candidate will be based in New York City, San Francisco, or Washington, DC.

We are a social enterprise and a certified B corporation with generous benefits including unlimited paid vacation, paid family leave, and health, vision and dental insurance. We enjoy our work, and working with each other.

The salary for Senior Campaigns Director is $130,500 in New York. We will also consider appointing exceptional candidates with even more additional senior experience for this role as Managing Director of Campaigns, with additional responsibilities and seniority, with a salary of $151,500 in New York.

Change.org is global company, and salaries are adjusted for cost of living in each city. (For example, a salary of $74,500 in New York would be $70,000 in DC or $76,500 in San Francisco). In exceptional circumstances, we may offer below the listed salary for high potential candidates with less experience, or above it for candidates with significantly more experience.

Change.org is committed to being a diverse and inclusive workplace. We strongly encourage applicants of different backgrounds, cultures, genders, experiences, abilities and perspectives to apply. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, age, physical disability, or length of time spent unemployed.

We are The Markup (https://themarkup.org/ ( https://themarkup.org/ )) -- a brand new nonpartisan, nonprofit journalism organization in New York City. We're hiring!

Our mission is to investigate and illuminate the societal effects of new technologies. With little accountability or oversight, technology is affecting who we vote for, how we raise our kids, who is able to get housing, jobs, healthcare and a comfortable life. We will investigate these impacts, with the goal of holding the powerful to account, raising the cost of bad behavior, and spurring reforms. We begin publishing in 2019.

The Markup is looking for experienced Investigative Reporters who have also demonstrated strong data skills to lead investigative projects.

The Markup is committed to building a team that includes a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives, and an organizational culture that is reader-centered, inventive, rigorous, and courageous. A collaborative team-based approach is core for us: we won't tolerate jerks. We aim to be a place where a diverse mix of dedicated people will want to come, to stay, and do their best work. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, country of origin, citizenship, ancestry, physical or mental disability, or veteran status.

------------------
About the position
------------------

At The Markup, investigations are the heart of what we do. We are seeking an inventive, rigorous and collaborative Senior Investigative Reporter who can lead investigations, be comfortable with data and spreadsheets, and write compelling articles based on our findings.

Our approach to investigative journalism is guided by the scientific method. We develop hypotheses and assemble data —through crowdsourcing, FOIAs, and automated data collection— to test our theories.

Senior Investigative Reporters will often work alongside a Data Journalist to conduct investigations. Together they will develop a hypothesis and strategize about data collection techniques. The Senior Investigative Reporter will develop the necessary domain expertise in the topic area, find interesting anecdotes to illustrate the findings and conceive and shape the narrative of the article.

This position will report to the Editor-in-Chief.

----------------
Responsibilities
----------------

Senior Investigative Reporters will be responsible for working closely with Data Journalists, producing and writing several investigations per quarter, as well as explanatory articles.

Investigative Journalism is a team sport. The Markup's Senior Investigative Reporters will work closely with Investigative Data Journalists to develop hypotheses, collect data and develop findings. You will also work with other parts of the newsroom to explain and promote your findings and with our editorial partners outside the newsroom.

You will also be the custodian of your own digital security. We will provide the tools, but you will need to use two-factor authentication, password managers, encryption and other tools and tactics that can help us protect our work and our sources.

------
Skills
------

Because our team- and data-based approach to journalism is new, there won't be many people who have done it before. So don't worry if you haven't done the exact type of data journalism we plan to practice. The skills we are looking for are:

You have strong data judgement and can see a story in a dataset.

You know how to spot a story. You have a minimum of five years of experience as an investigative journalist.

You know proven impact. You have worked on successful investigations that have led to real world change.

You are a fast, clean writer. You have spent a minimum of five years writing news articles on a deadline.

You are passionate about accuracy. You are willing to go the extra mile to check even facts that seem obvious.

You are skilled at cultivating relationships with sources and are diligent about protecting them.

You are data literate. You can use Excel (maybe you are not an expert, but are willing to learn) and committed to learning other technical skills on the job as needed.

You enjoy learning and are flexible. This is a new form of journalism and we'll all be learning how to do it together.

Experience covering the technology industry is a plus, but not a requirement.

------------
Compensation
------------

We pay people fair and reasonable salaries, in accordance with their skills and abilities and experience. We also provide a robust benefits package that includes medical, dental, vision, life, disability, and pet insurance and retirement plan contributions.

The salary for this position begins at $150,000, and will be established based on the successful candidate's experience, education and skills.

------------
How to apply
------------

We have engaged DRi Consulting to assist us with this search. To apply, please use the form below to submit a cover letter, resume, 3-5 clips of your previous work, and 3-5 story ideas for investigations you might want to pursue if you joined us. Applications that don't include a cover letter will not be considered. Please do not contact the hiring manager directly. Please do not send a CV or application package to staff at their individual email addresses. If you do, it will probably just get lost.

This position will work out of our New York City office. If you don't currently live in New York but are willing to relocate for this position, please make that clear in your cover letter. We will pay relocation expenses for successful candidates.

At this time, we can't consider applications from people who don't already have the legal right to work in the United States. In order to work for The Markup, you'll be required to provide documentation establishing that you're eligible for U.S. employment."

Grit . You are a go-to person who can be counted on at crunch time. You don’t take ‘no’ for an answer. You find a way.

Learning : You have an insatiable interest in learning about technology, retail trends, and changing consumer needs, and you regularly incorporate that learning into your own work. You strive to get better, every day.

Leadership : You can effectively lead others toward a clear experience vision, articulating the value of user-centered design, and the value of the end product to the business and to our customers.

The editor must have the highest journalism ethics and sound judgment; extraordinary skills as an editor; a commitment to understanding issues his or her team reports on; the ability to coach and collaborate with reporters and other editors to achieve high-quality journalism; a deep understanding of and enthusiasm for the modern, digital news ecosystem; a firm grasp of the art and the science of reaching digital readers through search, social media and other distribution channels; a complete commitment to defending the values of the First Amendment, holding leaders and institutions accountable, and speaking truth to power.

Our future lies in digital, and the editor will lead his or her team to focus squarely on serving the measurable needs and interests of digital readers. This will require a passion for reaching digital readers and growing digital readership as well as the ability to ignite that passion in others; the regular use of readership analytics and other data to inform decision-making; and a commitment to and skill in producing exclusive, high-impact journalism.

The content editor plays a crucial part in coaching reporters to put our readers at the center of everything we do. He or she will discuss every story idea with a reporter or visual journalist, asking who would care about the story. When necessary, the content editor must be the one to reject ideas or stories that do not fit McClatchy’s mission – freeing the reporter to spend time on work that matters to our readers. The editor will also monitor his or her reporters’ progress, ensuring everyone has the training and coaching needed to succeed in the new audience-focused mission.

The editor’s work (or the work of his/her staff) will be measured by the impact it has in the community, as measured by page views and other engagement-related analytics as well as adherence to McClatchy’s mission pillars.
ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS:

Skill and versatility as an editor and a writer, including the ability to shape everything from breaking news briefs to longform magazine-style pieces in a way that best serves and engages the broadest possible audience.
Sound news judgment, and a demonstrated ability to “see the story” that is going to matter to readers and to anticipate reader interests before they exist.
An interest in and aptitude for storytelling using a broad range of media, including the written word, video, photography, podcasts and other audio, and whatever comes next.
A commitment to understanding issues and topics his or her team reports on.
SKILLS AND DEMONSTRATED ABILITIES:
To consistently find and frame stories that resonate with the largest possible audience.
To write compelling headlines and relevant SEO metadata that will help the stories reach that audience.
To use social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to engage with audiences.
To use analytics such as page views, time on site, referral sources and “shares and likes” to help determine which stories resonate with which audiences.
Ability to say no when stories are too incremental, lack value or otherwise don’t meet our standards.
Ability to act as a proxy for our readers, asking the questions they want answered.
Understanding of metrics, and the ability to discuss with his/her reporters what they mean.
Willingness to have difficult conversations with reporters who are not meeting audience goals or core mission goals and to help them adjust their workflows, story selections or even beats to improve.
The ability to collaborate with colleagues throughout the newsroom.
Strong editing and writing skills and excellent news judgment.
Strong interpersonal skills, including empathy (toward readers and staff) and a superior ear for tone.
Comfort with a job that will be demanding, fast-paced, constantly evolving, and more outcome-oriented than task-oriented.

President,THE NEWBERRY LIBRARY,"Chicago, IL",2018-10-19 17:38:07,https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=97cd086c3f125409,NaN,indeed,"MISSION STATEMENT

The Newberry, open to the public without charge, is an independent research library dedicated to the advancement and dissemination of knowledge, especially in the humanities. The Newberry acquires and preserves a broad array of special collections research materials relating to the civilizations of Europe and the Americas. It promotes and provides for their effective use, fostering research, teaching, publication, and life-long learning, as well as civic engagement. In service to its diverse community, the Newberry encourages intellectual pursuit in an atmosphere of free inquiry and sustains the highest standards of collection preservation, bibliographic access, and reader services.
OVERVIEW

The Newberry Library, founded in 1887 as a bequest from Walter L. Newberry, one of Chicago's earliest philanthropists and cultural leaders, is a world-renowned independent research library serving scholars and the general public alike. The Newberry shares its vast collections of rare books, maps, personal papers, and other documents to stimulate intellectual research and public engagement. The Newberry makes its collections freely available to anyone over 14 years old a level of access that is unique among the Newberry's peer institutions.

Early in its history, the Newberry purchased collections that set the template for future acquisitions: comprehensive collections of original sources that would offer opportunities for study and in-depth research in designated areas. After an 1897 cooperative agreement with the John Crerar Library in Chicago and the Chicago Public Library to avoid duplication, the Newberry began to focus on the humanities.

The Library, which currently houses more than 1.6 million books, 5 million manuscript pages, and 500,000 historic maps, is renowned for its collections. Core collection strengths broadly include: maps, travel, and exploration; music from the Renaissance to the early twentieth century; medieval, Renaissance, and early modern studies; early contact between colonizers and Indigenous peoples in the Western Hemisphere; the personal papers of twentieth-century American journalists; railroad archives; the history of printing; genealogy; and Chicago and Midwestern history. Fellowships and a vibrant array of scholarly programs actively contribute to the work of the Library, particularly in the fields of its research centers: Renaissance Studies, the History of Cartography, and American Indian and Indigenous Studies; and in its Chicago Studies Program.

In addition to supporting and encouraging research, the Library continues to increase its focus on sharing its resources with the greater Chicago community, facilitating moments of discovery for users not only in its reading rooms but also in its lecture halls, exhibition galleries, adult education classes, and digital resources. In recent years, the Library's digital collections have grown substantially, with more than one million page views annually, and interactive digital resources that engage users at all levels. Its free public programming has grown to include lectures, panel discussions, historical reenactments, debates, music, and dance performances all drawing from its collections and attracting tens of thousands of visitors each year. The Newberry also serves area K-12 teachers and students through a variety of content-based education programs.

The Library recently completed a $12.7 million renovation of its first floor and lower level. The remodeled area represents a continuation of the Newberry ethos fostering a welcoming atmosphere and opportunities for visitors to engage with Library staff and collections. The renovations include spaces featuring state-of-the-art climate control and video equipment, allowing for rare and fragile materials to be used and shared broadly.

Located in Chicago's Gold Coast north of the Chicago River, the Library has an endowment of $79 million and an annual operating budget of $12 million. It has a 34-member Board and a staff of 108 dedicated professionals.

Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest international multimedia news provider reaching more than one billion people every day. Reuters provides trusted business, financial, national, and international news to professionals via Thomson Reuters desktops, the world's media organizations, and directly to consumers at Reuters.com.

Reuters is seeking a journalist to cover Wall Street banks and serve as a team leader overseeing our coverage of the industry as it moves from a period of restructuring and regulation to a time when business is booming again. Tax reforms engineered by the Trump administration have boosted the bottom line and spurred a spate of megadeals. Meanwhile, trading – once left for dead – has been buoyed by rising interest rates and global economic growth. Other areas like wealth management and asset management are flourishing as banks rely more on technology to keep costs contained.

However, boom times can come with excesses: more risk-taking, questionable products, bigger pay packages and lax oversight. The successful applicant will demonstrate a knack for conceptualizing and delivering stories that explain what’s happening inside Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and other large financial institutions, and how their actions affect clients, investors, taxpayers and consumers. The team leader would also collaborate with colleagues covering other banks and M&A to break news and drive deeper stories.

Responsibilities:
Pursue ambitious stories, including investigations, about Wall Street banks and their top executives
Break and handle major news about Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley
Develop sources across the broader industry, including investment bankers and traders at other big banks
Collaborate with colleagues throughout the Americas, and counterparts in Asia and EMEA, to tell global stories
Be familiar with multiple story-telling platforms including photos, video, text and social media
Requirements:
At least five years’ experience covering financial services firms or corporations
Proven track record of delivering scoops and insightful, agenda-setting stories
Ability to generate and articulate ideas to drive the file forward in original ways
Ability to partner well with different teams, across news bureaus and beats
An interest in editing stories and developing leadership skills
At Thomson Reuters, we believe what we do matters. We are passionate about our work, inspired by the impact it has on our business and our customers. As a team, we believe in winning as one - collaborating to reach shared goals, and developing through challenging and meaningful experiences. With more than 45,000 employees in more than 100 countries, we work flexibly across boundaries and realize innovations that help shape industries around the world. Making this happen is a dynamic, evolving process, and we count on each employee to be a catalyst in driving our performance - and their own.

To ensure we can do that, we seek talented, qualified employees in all our operations around the world regardless of race, color, sex/gender, including pregnancy, gender identity and expression, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, age, marital status, citizen status, veteran status, or any other protected classification under country or local law.

This reporter will be a self-starter who explores news and trends in cruising, air travel, hotels and attractions as they relate to the South Florida market.
S/he breaks news related to local companies and local interests, with an emphasis on stories that affect consumers. On this fast-paced beat, this requires staying abreast of developments by monitoring releases, social media and Google alerts, and posting online quickly to capitalize on digital traffic.
The ability to develop balanced working relationship and sources both within and outside major companies is essential. Through sources, local companies, trade organizations, data and government reports, this reporter also identifies trends relevant to local workers and employers, and examines those in enterprise stories that delve beneath the surface and beyond the predictable.
Among the questions s/he will ask:
What new and/or changing consumer offerings are available to South Floridians in terms of cruising, hotels, attractions and flights? How do those fit within a broader context of travel offerings? How might they affect the local economy or tourism industry?
How do hotels, cruise lines, airlines and attractions positively and negatively impact local wages, jobs and economy?
What conditions, government policies and practices affect worker and guest safety and comfort?
This beat requires a demonstrated commitment to fairness and accuracy, in fact and in tone, and a strong grounding in journalism ethics.

Like all reporters at the Miami Herald, this one will regularly engage with her/his editor to evaluate stories based on audience and mission to determine what is, and isn’t, worth pursuing.
 On audience:
Who cares about this (or who should)?
Is this a big enough group to make the idea worth pursuing the way it is framed?
Is there a way to extend/expand interest in this subject or information to make the group big enough?
If the group is small, is it influential enough to allow the story to have significant impact?
On mission:
Will the story break news that holds leaders or institutions accountable?
Will the story break news that makes a concrete difference in the community?
Will the story tell readers how something will directly affect their lives or the lives of their families or friends?
Will the story use extraordinary, revelatory story-telling to help readers understand a consequential societal issue in new ways?
Will the story (or sometimes a series of quick hits in the cases of breaking news) attract an extraordinary amount of readership or engagement because it is of great interest and/or value to our readers for other reasons?
Pluses include familiarity with the local region, personal or professional travel and/or cruise experience, data-reporting skills and Spanish-language skills.
This position reports to Business Editor Jane Wooldridge.
Minimum requirements:

2018 Atlantic Council-Korea Foundation Journalist Fellowship Program,Atlantic Council,"Washington, DC",2018-10-18 17:38:31,https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=dba88d9899f82642,NaN,indeed,"About


The Atlantic Council is proud to announce the 2018 Korea Journalist Fellowship Program. In partnership with the Korea Foundation, the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security will host the inaugural class of Fellows in Fall 2018. The Atlantic Council Korea Journalist Fellowship is a unique opportunity for early/mid-career US-based journalists working in US media to develop a deeper knowledge of the most critical economic and security issues on the Korean peninsula and in the Asia-Pacific more broadly. By engaging with the next generation of thinkers and policy shapers in Seoul and by working with leading experts in Washington, DC, Fellows will gain a better understanding of current attitudes and shifting perceptions that will affect the US-ROK relationship in years to come. Working with seasoned professionals in South Korea and the United States, Fellows will have the opportunity to broaden their professional portfolios while building lasting ties with their counterparts in Korea and contribute to the Atlantic Council’s ongoing mission of upholding the rules-based international order through engagement, dialogue, and fostering a Trans-Atlantic-Pacific community.


Structure:


The Fellowship program works to increase understanding between the Republic of Korea and the United States. The program will host eight to ten journalists interested in learning more about the Republic of Korea. The Fellowship will begin in fall 2018 and will include three private roundtables in Washington, DC as well as a trip to South Korea. The reception to launch this journalist fellowship will be held on November 1, 2018, and the journalists for the 2018 Class will be selected by the end of November. The Atlantic Council plans to host two roundtables prior to the delegation trip to Seoul, which is tentatively scheduled to happen sometime between December and February. The delegation will meet with high-level government officials and experts in South Korea. A final wrap-up roundtable will occur after the trip. Contingent on their selection as Fellows, journalists will commit to attending all three roundtables and joining the delegation on the ground in Seoul. Fellows should also be prepared to research at least one longer story during the program, and to publish at least one article/broadcast piece after the fellowship, though they will retain full editorial control of said piece. The Fellowship will cover travel, lodging, meals, and transportation for the trip to Seoul. Fellows who work outside of Washington, DC will be responsible for covering their own travel costs to Washington, DC for the private roundtables.


The roundtables will feature a panel of leading experts, academics, and government officials with experience working on economic and security issues in the Asia-Pacific. The roundtables will be an opportunity for Fellows to learn more about significant issues affecting the Korean peninsula, giving them an opportunity to benefit from the expertise of career foreign policy experts before the trip to Seoul. Fellows will be expected to stay up-to-date on any developments pertinent to US-ROK relations and to actively participate during the roundtable discussions.


2018 Program – A Way Forward for the Peaceful and Denuclearized Korean Peninsula


2018 has been a historic year for trilateral relations between the United States, Republic of Korea, and Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and despite all the developments that have happened thus far, the coming months promise to be equally momentous. As the three countries work toward a peaceful and denuclearized Korean Peninsula based on the agreements laid out in the Panmunjom Declaration, the Singapore Summit, and the Pyongyang Joint Declaration of September 2018, journalists and the media will play a key role in ensuring that both policymakers and the general public are well-informed and share a deep understanding of the process as it develops. As such, the inaugural class of Atlantic Council Korea Journalist Fellows will be provided with opportunities during their fellowship to meet with senior officials, seasoned journalists, and opinion leaders, enabling the Fellows to contribute to the ongoing dialogue taking place both on and about the future of the Korean Peninsula.

A little bit about our team:
Our team sets up, schedules and gets all the pieces in place for new digital releases to be delivered to digital service providers like Spotify, Apple, etc. and for new physical releases, mostly CDs & vinyl, to be manufactured.

Your work will be vital to having correct information as part of commercial offerings and in our databases.

You will manage the label copy as a live document that’s always changing by updating it as needed. You’ll manage keeping updated copies archived for future reference.
You will proofread metadata for accuracy before digital products are sent to DSPs. You’ll also proofread the copy on layouts of physical packaging and any DVD menu screens.
You will enter new release information into the company’s central database that feeds other databases to ensure accurate setup details are used company-wide. This will sometimes require researching any missing setup criteria, adjusting metadata so it meets the style guide requirements from various DSPs, and troubleshooting issues with validation at DSPs.
You will request overdue Master Delivery Request Forms/Mastering Requests from the label and create them for certain P&D labels.
You will be the point person for managing the security of metadata and some new release information as needed on high-profile artists.

Rockstar candidates will be able to:

We believe in improving people's lives by making transportation safer, more accessible, and more convenient. We're building the world's most advanced software ( https://www.driverless.id/news/video-breakdown-gms-unicorn-cruise-shows-off-level-4-skills-sf-passing-uber-maybe-waymo-0176031/ ) to fuel the driverless cars that safely connect people to the places, things, and experiences they care about.

We seek and embrace diversity in all of its forms. We continuously push ourselves to think differently and take ownership wherever it's needed. This is a place for dreamers and doers to succeed. If you share our passion for achieving what some say is impossible, join us.

About the role:
Cruise is developing technology that will impact generations to come. Our fast-growing communications team is seeking a Senior Writer/Editor who will write and edit copy intended for a variety of audiences including Cruise employees, our social media channels, members of the media, as well as the general public. The ideal candidate will be able to easily translate complicated technical concepts into language accessible to everyone.

Not only will you be the best writer on our team, you'll be the best editor. We will look to you to tackle the most difficult writing assignments quickly and to complete them ahead of schedule. We'll expect you to raise our game and coach everyone on the team to be a better writer.

Most likely, you'll be one of the most creative people we've ever worked with. While your work will be an important creative outlet for you, it's unlikely that it is your only creative outlet. We're expecting to hire a natural storyteller -- someone who knows how to craft a narrative. We also are seeking someone who can write blog posts and the occasional speech for for our C-level executives. Our goal will be to capture the individual voices of these executives, not to reshape them into someone that they're not.

While we expect we will learn from you, we also expect you will learn from us. Our team believes that by learning from one another, we are stronger and more effective than we would be otherwise.

It's not often that a communicator is given a ground-floor opportunity to help shape what will become one of the world's most told business stories of the next decade. This is that opportunity.

Day-to-day responsibilities include:

Communicate complex, state-of-the-art technology to a variety of audiences.
Research and write engaging copy for a variety of assignments -- everything from social media content, to pitch-emails to journalists, to copy for our employee communications newsletters.
Quickly adapt to last minute asks and changing timelines with flexibility and good humor.

Summer 2019 Opinion Internships in New York,Dow Jones,"New York, NY 10176 (Murray Hill area)",# an unknown date more than 30 days ago,https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=29be69d85bbab99e,NaN,indeed,"TemporaryJob Description:
The Wall Street Journal's Opinion section is seeking beginning journalists - juniors, seniors or recent graduates with reporting and writing backgrounds at their school newspapers or elsewhere - for 10-week paid summer internships in our New York City office.
Our internships - formally, the Bartley Fellowships - are in honor and memory of our section's former Editor, Robert L. (Bob) Bartley. Opportunities will be awarded to young thinkers and writers who intend to pursue a career in journalism, whose views are broadly consistent with Bob's, and the Opinion section’s, philosophy. It is essential that applicants be familiar with, and interested in, the ideas for which the Journal editorial page stands.
Several fellows will be selected each year through an application process that will be judged by senior editors. Bartley Fellows will be assigned to a department within the Opinion section - Features (Op-Eds and Columns); Arts in Review; or Book Reviews. They will assist in researching, writing and editing content for the print and digital editions of the Journal, and will contribute as needed to social media and digital production tasks. While they're assigned to a department for the summer, all interns are encouraged to submit their ideas for articles or projects to editors in any part of the Opinion section.
Internships are paid, and generally take place over June, July and August, though start dates can be flexible in certain circumstances.
If you are interested in applying for both the Opinion and Books/Arts Bartley fellowships, please submit separate applications to each position.
Guidelines and Application Deadline
Applicants should have direct experience writing, and ideally editing, in a journalism context. A demonstrated ability to multitask and meet daily deadlines is critical for success. Applicants should be familiar with technology as it relates to journalism. Social media experience with a publication or brand would be a plus. Applicants who are able to demonstrate familiarity with our section’s content will be especially attractive (student applicants without campus-wide access to the WSJ can purchase discounted subscriptions at wsj.com/studentoffer).
Students from any discipline may apply, but historically, we’ve been most interested in students concentrating in Journalism, Communications, Economics, Political Science, International Studies, History, a Foreign Language, Statistics, Finance, Pre-Law, Science, Business, Marketing, Religious Studies or Philosophy. Students from outside these disciplines are welcome to apply and should include a three-sentence case in their cover letter for why their field of study would be an asset for the section.
If you’d like to be considered, please submit the following in one single, complete PDF file:
A cover letter
Your resume
Links to or cited full text of your best clips
Your response to one of the following prompts in no more than 600 words
Write an editorial either consistent with the WSJ’s philosophy in response to a current event in the news, or defending your most controversial opinion. Write a sample letter to the editor responding to a recent WSJ editorial, Op-Ed or column. Compare and contrast two opposing arguments from any reliable, professional source(s) on the same topic. Submit an original investigative Op-Ed or original Opinion piece that is suitable in terms of style, tone of voice and topic for publication in the Journal.
All materials must be received by November 18, 2018 and a decision will be made by the end of December. Only applicants who are selected for final consideration will be interviewed.
About Bob Bartley
Throughout his 30 years as The Wall Street Journal’s Editorial Page Editor, Bob Bartley inspired principled and original thinking that changed and shaped the society in which we all live. He also devoted attention to teaching and motivating talented young people, many of whom have gone on to careers in journalism at the Journal and elsewhere. The Bartley fellowships are consistent with that legacy.
Bob Bartley achieved many honors during his long tenure here, including a Pulitzer Prize and, shortly before his death in December 2003, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In awarding that medal, President Bush cited Bob as ‘ one of the most influential journalists in American history. ’ The Robert L. Bartley fellowships will help to perpetuate not just Bob’s memory but, above all, the principles and priorities to which he devoted his distinguished career.
About the Opinion Section
Following the American newspaper practice, the heads of News and Editorial report independently to the publisher of the Journal and CEO of Dow Jones, William Lewis. The Editorial staff is responsible for the Opinion content published on WSJ.com, the editorial and op-ed pages of The Wall Street Journal in print, and criticism of books and the arts, which are recognized at the Journal as an Opinion function.
While The Wall Street Journal’s news pages are committed to informing our readers, our editorials are dedicated to advocating a consistent philosophy and positions that emanate from it. That philosophy can be summed up as ‘free markets, free people.’ We have stood for these fundamental principles even in times - and places - when they were not considered fashionable. While specific issues differ in various parts of the world, we view those issues through a consistent lens everywhere; for example, while protectionism is more popular in some parts of the world than others, our publications around the world are committed uncompromisingly to free trade.
We believe in the individual, in his wisdom and his decency. We oppose all infringements on individual rights, whether they stem from attempts at private monopoly, labor union monopoly or from an overgrowing government. Our section is not easily pigeonholed or predictable. We resist the label ‘conservative,’ in the sense of preserving the status quo, because we think it too confining, too devoid of the optimism inherent in trusting individual wisdom and decency.
It is also important to state clearly what our section does not represent. It is not partisan. Unlike many American publishers, we do not endorse political candidates, and from time to time we have important disagreements with all leading political figures. We view issues through the lens of our philosophy and let our readers decide which person or party best serves to protect market capitalism and self-government.
We believe that the ultimate function of opinion journalism is the same as the rest of the newspaper, to inform. But in opinion journalism we have the additional purpose of making an argument for a point of view. We often take sides on the major issues of politics and society, with a goal of moving policies or events in what we think is the best direction for the country and world. Our experience over many years is that even those of you who disagree with us on particular issues - or even on broader philosophical grounds - nevertheless respect us for the clarity, consistency and eloquence with which we present our point of view. In stating our own views forcefully, we hope to raise and sharpen the level of debate and knowledge. And we hope that our editorials reflect not merely the passing whim of passing editors, but a body of thought shaped by a century of tradition.

At Forrester, you’ll work with innovative clients at emerging and established brands; these are the business and technology leaders we inspire and who inspire us. The Forrester experience is built on a singular, powerful purpose: to challenge thinking and lead change.

About This Role:
Forrester analysts conduct innovative research and deliver advice through written reports, advisory consulting, client inquiries, and speeches. This Analyst will be a member of our infrastructure and operations (I&O) team and will advise clients about data center services including colocation, cloud computing, and networking.

This Analyst will evaluate technology and market developments to help enterprises navigate the complex landscape of infrastructure design and development, with a heavy emphasis on data center services, wide area networking and other communications options, and systems design for technology — all with a special focus on software-defined capabilities. The Analyst will write and speak on how these developments give companies a competitive advantage through quicker agility, higher quality, faster performance, and software automation.

Candidates will need a strong understanding of the technology services landscape, design thinking, the approaches and processes used by traditional and emerging technology providers, and the business technology issues facing business executives today. They will couple this with an appetite for conducting and writing research to stay abreast of the issues.
Responsibilities
Analysts work as part of a small high-performance global team of other analysts and researchers. The Analyst will collaborate with others in all aspects of the job. He or she will:

Write high-quality research (in English) that conveys new ideas to help I&O professionals and other technology decision makers solve their business problems and develop their strategies. This research typically: 1) introduces new thinking about successful business and technology strategies; 2) helps clients understand the impact of technology and regulatory issues; or 3) assesses new technologies or services and their potential to help clients solve their business challenges.
Help clients to apply Forrester’s research in the context of their specific business environments and help solve their problems through telephone and email responses to questions from Forrester clients, in-person advisory, and consulting projects.
Present at Forrester-sponsored forums and seminars, and deliver client webinars.
Establish an industry presence as an influential speaker and thinker. Build relationships with senior technology professionals, as well as with the technology vendors who serve them and the journalists who cover the sector.
Take complex, disparate ideas and distill them into simple, provocative concepts — and be willing to take a stand on strategies and outcomes.
Qualifications
A strong record of academic achievement: B.A. or B.S. minimum.
A background in technology development, operations, or strategy. Candidates must have at least five years of proven experience working in a corporate IT organization or a technology provider to these IT customers.
Specific experience in wide area networking, colocation services, or cloud computing; this is essential.
A good understanding of modern software development; this is an advantage, as much of the technology is now software-defined.
Solid business instincts and a practical understanding of what makes companies tick and how digital business executives operate.
Previous analyst experience; this is a plus.
Deep intellectual curiosity about technology design, the impact of technology on customer experiences, and how vendors can help customers create complete systems of technology.

Present at Forrester-sponsored and industry-related events and deliver client webinars.

Superior listening, critical thinking, and writing skills, as well as memorable presentation skills. Principal/Senior Analysts are expected to take complex, disparate ideas and distill them into simple, provocative concepts — and be willing to take a stand on vendors and outcomes.

Needed: You’ll help develop a holistic understanding of the user and leading research activities associated with the vision and development of our new consumer wellness products.

At Bose, we’ve spent more than 50 years finding new ways to bring quality audio products to people—in their homes, in automobiles, in airplanes, and just about anywhere else that there is a possibility to enjoy music. Our legendary Wave® music system, SoundLink® Mini Bluetooth speaker, or QuietComfort® acoustic noise canceling headphones may ring a bell with you. Bose relies on exceptional people to create and deliver those products to our customers.

As a Sr User Researcher on the User Centered Design team, you will lead the a variety of user research activities, execution, analysis and presentation. You will create holistic view of the user in all their complexities. You’ll work as a trusted partner with the marketing, engineering, and user centered design teams to bring this vision to life. Your role will be to help the team understand how quantitative research can support them in making good decisions and how best to execute on those needs with the team.

If you enjoy making a real impact on the business and the world, and you enjoy working on teams with other really smart people, then we want to meet you.

Requirements:
Can you confidently check all the boxes below?

Technical/Functional Competencies

User Research : You have strong user research expertise, to include ethnographic, resonance, concept testing, and technology assessments with users; usability testing; and collecting secondary research relevant to the team’s needs. Your skills are broad and deep, from shoulder-deep SPSS analysis to machine learning algorithms.

Analytics : You have deep critical thinking skills for framing, analyzing, and synthesizing complex problems (both qualitative and quantitative user research, and usability testing). You’re trained to deliver thoughtful and complete protocols, execute moderation and do complex analysis. Particularly on the quantitative side. You don’t just solve the problems identified by others; you highlight the problems others don’t notice. You can easily switch between qualitative and quantitative research methodologies with ease, and have the uncanny ability to know which is best for the goals and objectives of the team. This is not an easy job. You use python and R with ease and are interested in broadening your tools to include machine learning and complex data science toolkits that will be is applied to product design.

Communication : You have excellent visual, verbal, and written communication and presentation skills as well as a solid portfolio of past work. You have the ability to present complex data results of research in a rich compelling manner verbally and visually. Simple pivot tables are not what we are talking about.

Interpersonal Skills

Innovation : You have experience with innovation and new-to-the-world consumer products and businesses, rather than incremental product line extensions. You have an affinity for emerging technology (e.g., consumer wellness, IoT, AR/VR), market trends, and new gadgets. What we want you to help us with is not adding a new color or accessory, but rather to commercialize something really big, really new, and really cool.

Passion : You are driven – in your personal and professional life – by a burning desire to make a difference and change the world.

Confidence : You have the presence and credibility to command the respect of partners, journalists, senior stakeholders, and colleagues across all functional disciplines. You are confident but not cocky.

Organization : You are capable of multi-tasking and prioritizing your own work, as we balance the conflicting demands of product development, user testing, channel development, and launch planning. You learned to juggle in college.

Grit . You are a go-to person who can be counted on at crunch time. You don’t take ‘no’ for an answer. You find a way.

Learning : You have an insatiable interest in learning about technology, retail trends, and changing consumer needs, and you regularly incorporate that learning into your own work. You strive to get better, every day.

Leadership : You can effectively lead others toward a clear experience vision, articulating the value of user-centered design, and the value of the end product to the business and to our customers.

Collaboration : You enjoy engaging with multiple team members and value diverse perspectives. You are open to feedback and recognize the necessity of working together to get a product out the door.

Motivation : You have a proven ability to drive cohesion and collaboration among many different people and functions. You know how to motivate others.

Production : You are driven to get things done. You recognize opportunities to work smarter, drive improvement activities, and organize, plan, and deliver high quality, thoughtful approached to the research needs of the team.

Masters degree in Neuroscience, Psychology, Computer science, Human Factors, Behavioral sciences, HCI, Ergonomics, or a related field, with a minimum of 3 years of related work experience.

Role Summary
IDEO San Francisco’s Design for Learning Studio is in search of a Writer, Problem Solver & Poet with a passion for creating change in the education space.
Wanted: Total Unicorn
Maybe you’ve spent your career in advertising. Or maybe you’ve worked as a journalist. Maybe you’ve been stuck writing corporate communications, but have a secret stash of powerful, personal work that shows the true depth and breadth of your voice. Either way, you’re a writer who revels in the art of the details, with an itch to shape the bigger picture.
You can cut straight to the heart of the matter, and love making complex stuff feel simple and intuitive. You know how to persuade tough crowds, fluidly crafting different tones to meet your audience. You’re nimble, easily able to shift from punchy headlines, to long form stories, or whatever the situation calls for. You’re always pushing your craft, experimenting with new and better ways to convey a message. And on top everything, you’re a natural problem solver. In fact, calling you a writer doesn’t do justice to your unique mix of skills.
We’ve got a position that needs a little bit of all of this—but most of all, requires a drive to create positive impact through your work. You game? Then read on for the more brass tacks deets…
What will your role at IDEO look like?
IDEO is a human-centered design and innovation consultancy – and our design process starts and ends with storytelling. The right words can make learning engaging, help ideas stick, move people to action, and even create movements.
Writers at IDEO don’t just put the punch or polish in communications, they are designers who architect ideas alongside a multidisciplinary team of creative thinkers. Deep diving into content and collaborating in a team environment are central to day-to-day living at IDEO. You’ll do everything from uncover insights and tell inspiring stories, to create brand strategies, and design new to the world products, services and experiences.
About the Design for Learning Studio
IDEO San Francisco’s Education Studio focuses on designs that improve experiences for learners of all ages. This could be as micro as designing a tablet-based learning platform, and as macro as redesigning an entire education system. We nerd out over education trends and cool kid designs in equal measure – and we hope you do too.
Some projects from the Design for Learning studio to check out:
An app that helps first-generation college-goers stay in college
A literacy platform for early education classrooms in Brazil
Re-imagining the school cafeteria experience for San Francisco’s schools
A school system for the emerging middle class in Peru that is affordable and scalable
A network for teachers to collaborate and design solutions to challenges they face in the classroom
A couple projects from IDEO writ large that demonstrate the role of writing in creating more powerful design experiences.
A support network and suite of tools to help women stay on top of their sex life
A retail environment and digital tools to support millennials with financial literacy

Lead the best work by Idaho’s best reporters, surrounded by mountains, rivers and the high desert sagebrush sea.

The Times-News in Twin Falls, Idaho, is seeking an enterprise editor in charge of our Big Story section, a four-page spread in every Sunday edition and special online presentation focusing on watchdog reporting, investigative journalism and top-notch storytelling.

Recent story examples include piecing together a string of pharmacy robberies that shed light on the nation’s opioid crisis, a three-part story on problems in Idaho’s foster care system, a multi-part project on the growing Hispanic population of a nearby city, a yearlong series following a refugee family who landed in Twin Falls the day the state’s governor announced he supported halting refugee arrivals, a package on a creative writing class in prison and a piece on Idaho’s dire rural doctor shortage.

You’ll work one-on-one with reporters and photographers in developing project ideas weeks or months in advance, methodically edit stories and guide the whole package through the design process.

This is a dream job for journalists who love fantastic storytelling and the kinds of pieces that change lives, laws and the way people think. Whether it’s a 1,000-word story that’s heavy on visual elements or a multi-part, 8,000-word package on how public policy affects real people locally, this job offers the opportunity to make the Big Story section your own.

You’ll also work with other managers on our daily digital strategy, assisting on breaking news when needed and pushing stories on social media.

This position holds a place on our editorial board and is in charge of writing two or three editorials a week.

This position also produces the weekly Outdoors page, giving you a chance to get out of the office and explore some of the most scenic settings in the United States. It’s one of our most popular feature sections and includes local columns and reader-submitted content.

The Magic Valley has a population of about 185,000 and is one of the fastest-growing communities in the Northwest. The economy is booming as it shifts from traditional agriculture to high-tech food science and manufacturing.

Chobani built the world’s largest yogurt factory here, and Clif Bar recently opened its first in-house bakery here. We are a family-friendly and affordable community with access to world-class skiing, and the best trout stream in the West an hour drive from your front door, not to mention access to kayaking, hiking, biking, rock climbing and hunting in all directions.

Downtown Twin Falls recently had a $17 million facelift, with new restaurants and shops opening all the time. We are two hours from Boise and three hours from Salt Lake City.


A year or more of editing and management experience at a daily is preferred
Must be comfortable using social media to promote stories.
Must be self-motivated, hyper-organized, innovative and creative.
Must be able to manage multiple deadlines and multiple priorities while maintaining professionalism in the workplace.
Possess a bachelor’s degree in journalism or related field or equivalent hands-on experience.

The Times-News is a 17,500-circulation daily newspaper (21,500 on Sundays) owned by Lee Enterprises. It offers a competitive salary, medical, dental, vision, and life insurance benefits, vacation, sick, holiday pay and 401K-retirement plan.

PR
Do you want to help tell the story of Netflix? Do you enjoy shaping communications strategy and messaging? I mean, really enjoy thinking about them and putting new ideas forward. Do you live and breathe entertainment? Do you read or watch media coverage on a network, executive or television series and get curious about how it came to be and wonder how it could be improved? Do you thrive in a fast-paced environment? If so, we may have just the opportunity for the right person on the originals publicity team.

The Opportunity
Fueled by the broad appeal of being able to instantly enjoy unlimited movies and TV shows, Netflix has grown to more than 117 million streaming members in over 190 countries. This is the total package - a great opportunity to join a team that is spearheading and handling communications and publicity campaigns for a fast-growing and highly admired company, across overall strategy and messaging, series publicity, executive communications, appearances and crisis management. And you’ll get to work with some of the most exciting and creative people in the business.

The Role
The Manager of Content Communications will work in conjunction with the LA publicity leadership team to primarily help set and implement communications strategy and craft messaging for content teams and executives, while also managing executive appearances and crisis communications. She or he also will be responsible for series publicity initiatives, as well as trade/consumer press announcements.

The Manager will have past experience in helping create, shape, execute and manage entertainment trade/consumer communications strategy, both on the corporate/executive side and the series campaign side. They will have experience in communicating with executives, filmmakers, talent and production company partners. She or he will have exemplary media relations, particularly with trade/industry press in both Los Angeles and New York. They can skillfully and thoughtfully craft narratives, boil down complex concepts into succinct pitches and secure and work with media across broadcast, print, online and radio in both the trade and consumer space. International experience or knowledge of international media is a bonus. They have also worked alongside agencies, or have managed agencies or consultants on projects. They can formulate and manage a budget, and give visibility into their process successfully.

The ideal candidate is able to make wise decisions, even when faced with ambiguity, and thinks strategically at all times. He/she is not defined by past experiences and is eager to put a new spin on what publicity can be. They can articulate what they are - and are not - trying to do. He or she is a good listener and a real doer, and is able to multitask and work at a clip pace. They are not afraid to get their hands dirty - and that could mean jumping in to handle tasks that range from writing a strategy, writing a series announcement, or helping cover a set visit, if necessary. We are a small team, so the responsibility really is wide-ranging. They collaborate well with partners that range from content/programming to marketing to social to product and beyond. Strong candidates can handle a vast amount of work and they are eager to learn. They are curious and also contribute effectively outside of their speciality. A good fit in the role has a candid and direct communication style, they are willing to admit to mistakes quickly and questions values inconsistent with our values and Netflix culture. They understand that sometimes the job requires delivering bad news, and they’re tactful in handling such issues.

Qualifications
The successful candidate for Manager, Content Communications will have at least 7+ years of entertainment experience in a studio, network, agency or journalism setting. Background in Communications/Corporate Communications preferred.

Who you’ll work with:
We have a team of more than 200 journalists working from 11 newsrooms across Southern California. A few have won Pulitzer Prizes. Some are just starting out. A few grew up in the communities they cover. Some are still learning that the West Coast is the best coast. What we have in common is a belief that local journalism is important and we’re all doing our part to change the world for the better
What we like about working here, as told by people who work here:
If I have an idea, I can make a case for it and lead its creation

"Adjunct Instructor, Spies Like Us: Operational Security and Tradecraft for Journalists",USC,"Los Angeles, CA",2018-10-27 17:39:38,https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=d3c35cd2f024b644,NaN,indeed,"The Annenberg School of Journalism at the University of Southern California seeks a highly qualified adjunct instructor to teach JOUR 499 Spies Like Us: Operational Security and Tradecraft for Journalists.

This course teaches journalists advanced techniques for effectively and safely reporting on sensitive, difficult and potentially dangerous subjects. We will approach the enterprise of reporting from the standpoint of an intelligence officer, borrowing the best tradecraft that spies, federal agents, police officers, and analysts use to find sources, evaluate their credibility, elicit information from them, analyze that information, and protect the agents of information from legal (and perhaps) physical jeopardy. We will re-reverse engineer the tactics, techniques and procedures that are used against journalists with the aim of protecting and hardening the reporting process itself.

We will identify threats to the physical safety and welfare (online and offline) of journalists, threats to the security of their reporting and their communications, and threats to sources, and we will work on a set of best practices to defend and mitigate these threats.

We will practice real-world scenarios, including counter-surveillance detection, source meetings, reporting from the scenes of active emergencies, and basic situational awareness. We’ll use case studies, interview subject matter experts, and experiment with new technology.

By the end of the course, students will be expected to think strategically and creatively about the security of themselves, their sources, their publications and their reporting teammates.

Requirements for consideration include a B.A., B.S., M.S., or an M.A. degree in a related field. Previous teaching experience is desirable. For some courses, outstanding professional experience may be substituted for academic credentials.

The instructor for this class must have at least ten years of experience as a sworn agent of a federal law enforcement agency, or as an operations officer or analyst with an intelligence agency; direct experience dealing with the press in that capacity is preferred, as is a demonstrated commitment to the first principles of journalism. A knowledge of basic reporting practices, investigatory tradecraft, cyber security issues and national security law would be a plus.

The USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism is among the nation’s leading institutions devoted to the study of communication, journalism and public relations. With an enrollment of 2,400 undergraduate and graduate students, USC Annenberg scholars, both students and faculty, are defining these fields for the 21st century and beyond.

As we grow and scale, our portfolio of data storage options will need to grow with us.

Responsibilities

We're looking to establish a team of engineers who will be dedicated to databases and storage at Cloudflare. This team will encompass the full lifecycle of provisioning, monitoring, tuning, and scaling storage solutions. This team will work closely with both SRE and Engineering to provide a highly-automated, highly available and extremely resilient data platform that scales with us.

Expertise in operating/administering a traditional relational database system, preferably PostgreSQL
Experience writing, debugging, and tuning SQL.

Experience managing distributed storage systems such as Ceph and HDFS.
Experience developing software in Go, Python or C/C++
Formal computer science background (BS/MS in Computer Science or equivalent)
Experience with alerting and monitoring tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, and Kibana
Experience with configuration management software, preferably Salt.

Bonus Points


Interest in newer database technologies like CockroachDB
Experience with stream processing technologies
Experience with non-relational data stores such as time-series databases (ex. OpenTSDB), key-value stores (ex. Redis), columnar databases (ex. ClickHouse), and full text search engines (ex. ElasticSearch)
Experience with data warehousing tools and patterns

What Makes Us Special

We're not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We're a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo ( https://blog.cloudflare.com/protecting-free-expression-online/ ): We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare's enterprise customers--at no cost.

Project Athenian ( https://www.cloudflare.com/athenian/ ): We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership ( https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/path-forward/ ): Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1 ( https://1.1.1.1/ ): We released 1.1.1.1 ( https://1.1.1.1/ ) to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here's the deal - we don't store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy policy ( https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/commitment-to-privacy/privacy-policy/privacy-policy/ ) and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

We are an independent nonprofit organization – the sole beneficiary of seven individual trusts established between 1948 and 1979 by two sons and two daughters of Sun Oil Company founder Joseph N. Pew and his wife, Mary Anderson Pew.

Our work lays the foundation for effective policy solutions by informing and engaging citizens, linking diverse interests to pursue common cause and insisting on tangible results. Our projects encourage efficient, responsive governments – at the local, state, national and international levels – serving the best interests of the people. We partner with a diverse range of donors, public and private organizations and concerned citizens who share our interest in fact-based solutions and goal-driven investments to improve society.

With offices in Philadelphia, Washington DC, Australia, Brussels and London, and with additional staff in other regions of the United States and around the globe, Pew provides an exciting learning environment and the opportunity to work with highly talented individuals. We are a dynamic, rapidly evolving organization that values creativity and innovative thinking and fosters strong teamwork with mutual respect.

The vice president also oversees the program coordination and services function, which coordinates program-wide engagement with operations units, oversees key crosscutting program functions, and manages the program executive team, which supports the executive vice president and chief program officer.

The vice president reports to the executive vice president and chief program officer.

The vice president sits on the leadership team for the institution and is a member of program’s senior management team, which is comprised of the executive vice president, six vice presidents, and five senior directors.

The research and science portfolio includes several project and support teams that house nearly 70 staff, including:

Stateline focuses on four topics that are key to state policy: demographics, fiscal and economic issues, health care, and the business of government.
Research review and support (RRS), a group of experienced researchers and analysts that carries out the research review process that works to ensure quality research across Pew. RRS helps project teams design and implement high-quality research reports, studies, issue briefs, surveys, and other data-driven research; validates research quality for all projects from initial proposal through to the post-analysis data checks; advises project teams on methodological or analytical questions; and provides research assistance.
